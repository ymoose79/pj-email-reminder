# svelte-kitPJ
a glorified todo app utilizing CRUD that acts as a sort of Email interface


## what this project does
The page loads a form w/ text inputs that assign date, subject, email, importance, etc... to an email which then gets displayed as a draft.  The user can then choose to send the email, store to a database or delete it.  

## purpose of this project
The purpose of this was just to get my feet w/ using svelte-kit which is currently still in Beta.  Finding resources to complete this project was challanging, as there's not a lot of documentation out there.
